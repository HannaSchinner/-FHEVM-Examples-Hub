Welcome to the FHEVM Examples Hub, a comprehensive platform for learning and implementing privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

This project, submitted for the Zama Bounty Track December 2025, demonstrates complete automation for creating FHEVM examples with zero complexity.

Let me show you what we've built.

First, the project structure contains everything you need: eight smart contracts from basic to advanced examples, automated scaffolding tools, complete documentation, and a production-ready base template.

Let's start with installation and compilation.

We run npm install to get all dependencies, then npm run compile to build the smart contracts. The Solidity code includes comprehensive comments explaining each FHEVM concept, from encrypted variables to permission management.

Next, let's run the test suite.

We execute npm run test. Our tests demonstrate both successful operations and common mistakes, helping developers understand best practices. The tests show correct patterns with checkmarks and incorrect patterns with X marks.

Now comes the powerful part: automated documentation generation.

We run npm run generate-all-docs. This automatically extracts code from contracts and tests, generating GitBook-compatible markdown documentation. No manual documentation needed.

Let's create a standalone example repository.

We run npm run create-example fhe-counter ./my-example. This command generates a complete, independent Hardhat project ready to use. It includes the contract, tests, configuration, and documentation.

The generated repository is fully functional. We can navigate into it, install dependencies, compile, and test immediately. Complete autonomy.

Here's what we've delivered: seven production-ready example contracts demonstrating FHE concepts, three automation tools for scaffolding and documentation, a complete base template, comprehensive testing framework, and full documentation for developers.

The examples progress from basic concepts like encryption and arithmetic to advanced patterns like access control and real-world applications like private music royalty distribution.

Every contract includes detailed JSDoc comments explaining the why, not just the what. Developers can learn FHEVM best practices directly from the code.

Our automation tools solve real problems: creating examples is one command, documentation is auto-generated, and deploying to any network is straightforward.

The project demonstrates innovation in developer experience. Automation reduces manual work, examples teach concepts progressively, and documentation stays synchronized with code.

This is the FHEVM Examples Hub: making privacy-preserving smart contracts accessible to all developers.

Thank you.
